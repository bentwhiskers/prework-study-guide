        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage to make it visually appealing to users</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly, and is useful for quick & permanent changes</li>
          <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the "head" section of the HTML file, and rules only apply for that page</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common way to style a webpage, and a file must be linked in the HTMLs "head"</li>
          <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicate how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
