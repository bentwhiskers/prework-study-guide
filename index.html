        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements, or the type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Each element is composed of an opening tag and a closing tag "< >"</li>
          <li>The "head" element contains metadata that helps render the page correctly, and is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The "body" element contains the content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>the "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport </li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>Headings, "h1 - h6", are elements that define prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page</li>
          <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The "ul, ol, and li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
          <li>The "img" element contains info about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The "br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between content</li>
          <li>The "a" element, or anchor element, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li>The "header" element appears at the top of the page and usually has a navigation menu and/or intro content</li>
          <li>The "main" element is where the main information of a webpage goes</li>
          <li>The "footer" element appears at the bottom of a page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>The "section" elements allow one to organize the content of a page based on its topics</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage to make it visually appealing to users</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly, and is useful for quick & permanent changes</li>
          <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the "head" section of the HTML file, and rules only apply for that page</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common way to style a webpage, and a file must be linked in the HTMLs "head"</li>
          <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicate how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to add styles to certain elements, but not all of them, by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in HTML, letting us choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
          <li>The CSS file must be linked within the head section of the HTML file, after the meta element and before the title element, to properly appear on a webpage</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>To access Git we use the command line, and commands always start with git</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can create a repository (or repo), add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code (which are each stored in a unique commit)</li>
          <li>To collaborate using Git with others, you muse use GitHub: a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repos that are stored remotely</li>
          <li>GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. You create a branch in your repo, then make as many changes to the repo without affecting the main branch of the repo</li>
          <li>Then commit and push your changes to your branch, giving each commit a descriptive message to help you and future contributors understand what changes the commit contains</li>
          <li>Next, create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on the changes. Include a summary of the changes and the problem they solve</li>
          <li>Then merge the pull request so your changes appear on the main (or default) branch. After merging, delete your branch so it is not accidentally used later</li>
          <li>GitHub issues (a task management tool in GitHub) are often formatted with a language called Markdown, and are used to help us keep track of our progress and meet deadlines</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>To declare a variable in JS, we use the var keyword</li>
          <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a unique name (which will be how we reference the info stored in the variable)</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator, or = , to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>The variable can contain a string, or multiple pieces of data that are being stored within the variable. The string is contained within quotation marks (")</li>
          <li>To access a string, refer to the variable's name</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the botto of the page</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted by using conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is executed at all</li>
          <li>An if statement is a conditional statement that allows us to introduce decision making into our code - when using it, code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition, or is true</li>
          <li>You can have more than one condition by using 'else if' statements follwing the first 'if' statement</li>
          <li>Loops help to efficiently log all of the values in an array, without having to manually change the values of the index</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices (numbers) to perform a certain task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>In order to use a for loop, we need the index and the array's length. Array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array</li>
          <li>A for loop contains 3 three important statements: the starting point for our loop, the condition, and the final statement that allows the array to increase by 1 each time</li>
          <li>The code that we want executed for each loop goes inside curly brackets { } after the 3 statements</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data - usually data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items within the array, we need one more piece of info: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index</li>
          <li>The first item in an array has an index number of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time</li>
          <li>To access only one item in an array, start with the name of the variable that stores the array, then add the index of the first item of data within square brackets [ ]</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JS file is run - you must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
          <li>It is common to indent the for loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure</li>
          <li>Declaring a function does not mean that the code will automatically execute - we need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute</li>
